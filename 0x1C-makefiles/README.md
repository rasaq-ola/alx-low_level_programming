# 0x1C. Makefiles

## Description
This project covers the creation and usage of Makefiles for compiling C programs and includes a Python script to calculate the perimeter of an island in a grid.

## Files
- `0-Makefile`: Simple Makefile to compile `main.c` and `school.c`.
- `1-Makefile`: Uses variables for compiler and source files.
- `2-Makefile`: Adds object files and executable name variables, ensures recompilation of only updated files.
- `3-Makefile`: Adds rules for cleaning and recompiling.
- `4-Makefile`: Includes compiler flags and extended cleaning rules.
- `5-island_perimeter.py`: Python script to calculate the perimeter of an island in a grid.
- `5-main.py`: Script to test the `island_perimeter` function.
- `main.c`, `school.c`: Source files to be compiled.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage
To compile the C programs, run the following commands:
